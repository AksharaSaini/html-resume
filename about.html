<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Salut! I am Akshara Saini. I'm about to be 21 years born on 30 April 2003 ( if you want to send some gifts, feel free to contact me;) 
  ) I am from Delhi, the capital of India. I don't want to talk about the boring part some people might find that I'm a Bachelor of 
  Technology student in Information Technology studying from IP University. Right now my focus is to become a proficient high-level coder. I 
  like to challenge myself with different coding problems by using Python or Java languages. Also, recently my interest began growing 
  more towards Web Development( creating and styling websites are fun:) ) Oops! Do I sound like a "nerd" now? Well your mind would change 
  in a few minutes from now.</p>

<p>I live with my family(I'm again starting now). Since I was a child, I love to try new things plus not only I "try" them, I master 
  those hobbies( I am not trying to brag here :p) ). I have played a lot of sports which include badminton, basketball, swimming, 
  volleyball and if house cricket counts too then cricket too. I participated in a few tournaments for basketball where our team have 
  earned positions as well. I love to paint and draw and craft things. You can find many a things at my house which are old than a 
  decade as well( I keep them safe even after shifting many places). If you want to know more about my hobbies I can tell you more when
  we meet in person LOL. Not to sound creepy but I'm a perfectionist from heart( No I don't have ADHD).</p>

<p>This year leaning more towards my creative side I made a vision board for myself which I am very proud of!(Let's forget this was a 
  plan initially for the year 2023 but its execution was done for the year 2024 :') ) This page itself is a part of my course I am
  learning and working on currently( It's actually 3:40 in the morning and I should get to sleep). I am excited for the future and 
  looking forward for the same.</p>
